# SIGNATURE-DETECTION
This project utilizes web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create a user interface for a signature detection system. While the core signature detection functionality wouldn't be implemented in this front-end focused project, the UI will guide users through the process and prepare the data for further processing.
